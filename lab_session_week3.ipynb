    "## Solution with QR Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing a solve instead of a matrix inverse is the more numerically stable approach, but we can do even better. A [QR-decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) of a matrix factorises it into a matrix which is an orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{Q}$, so that $\\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{Q} = \\mathbf{I}$. And a matrix which is upper triangular, $\\mathbf{R}$. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{X}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R})^\\top (\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R})\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{R})^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{R}^\\top (\\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{Q}) \\mathbf{R} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{R}^\\top \\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{R}^\\top \\mathbf{R} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{R}^\\top \\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{R} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{Q}^\\top \\mathbf{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is a more numerically stable solution because it removes the need to compute $\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\mathbf{X}$ as an intermediate. Computing $\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\mathbf{X}$ is a bad idea because it involves squaring all the elements of $\\mathbf{X}$ and thereby potentially reducing the numerical precision with which we can represent the solution. Operating on $\\mathbf{X}$ directly preserves the numerical precision of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be more particularly seen when we begin to work with *basis functions* in the next week. Some systems that can be resolved with the QR decomposition can not be resolved by using solve directly."
